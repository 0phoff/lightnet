Building blocks to recreate Darknet networks in Pytorch


# Why another framework
[pytorch-yolo2](https://github.com/marvis/pytorch-yolo2) is working perfectly fine, but does not easily allow a user to modify an existing network.
This is why I decided to create a library, that gives the user all the necessary building blocks, to recreate any darknet network.  
This library has everything you need to control your network, weight loading & saving, datasets, dataloaders and data augmentation.
