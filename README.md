Building blocks to recreate Darknet networks in Pytorch


## Why another framework
[pytorch-yolo2](https://github.com/marvis/pytorch-yolo2) is working perfectly fine, but does not easily allow a user to modify an existing network.
This is why I decided to create a library, that gives the user all the necessary building blocks, to recreate any darknet network.  
This library has everything you need to control your network, weight loading & saving, datasets, dataloaders and data augmentation.

## How to use
_WIP_

## Credits
Credits where credits are due.  
This library would not have been possible without the great work of the following people:
  - [pjreddie et al.](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet) for their work on the original YOLO networks
  - [marvis](https://github.com/marvis/pytorch-yolo2) for his implementation of YOLO in pytorch. I took a lot of parts from this repository, and tweaked them to my needs.
