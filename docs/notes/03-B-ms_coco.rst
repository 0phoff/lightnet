MS COCO
=======
This page explains the code from the `MS COCO repository <ln-coco_>`_. |br|
These scripts were build to test the results of lightnet on the MS COCO dataset and compare them with darknet,
and as such are a nice example of some real code to learn from.


.. Warning::
   The COCO repository is still a WIP, where we try to integrate Lightnet with PyTorch Lightning.
   Feel free to check it out for yourself, but beware that the results might not yet be entirely correct. |br|
   We will update this page once the code is completely in working order!
